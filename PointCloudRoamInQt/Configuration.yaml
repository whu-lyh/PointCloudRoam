#Roam view Info

#The osg coordinate definition as left-hand coordinate which is right-front-up(x-y-z) and 
#the OpenGL coordinate definition also as left-hand coordinate which is right-up-behind(x-y-z), z axis is pointer to outside the screen
#Initial viewport is along down direction, so heading is rotate to along the y positive direction, rotate axis is x axis 

#y point to the trajectory direction, -z point to down view, y-down-45 point to y axis and 45 degree
ViewportDirection: "y-down-45"
#speed is  //larger ==> slower
RoamSpeed: 0.5
